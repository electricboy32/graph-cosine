I have a file data.csv containing show_id,type,title,director,cast,country,date_added,release_year,rating,duration,listed_in,description.
Create a python file to load this data for graphic display. The end goal should be to visualise whether netflix releases more tv series than movies.

Change the graph so it now displays year by year movies vs tv show releases so we can see if over time, more tv series are released

What is plot_type_distribution? Is it part of a library I don't have installed or have you not defined it properly? There is no def anywhere in the code
